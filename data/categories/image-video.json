      "description": "thesixtyone is Digg for new music, a social filter for the tsunami of indie creativity hitting the web. Like Digg, the homepage is community driven. Listeners who sign up are given a daily number of \"hearts\" they can use to vote on songs they like. If songs you heart become popular, you earn reputation points, level up, and unlock community abilities. Listeners can also earn achievement badges for various activities, like hearting songs in under-explored genres or reaching a playcount milestone. All tracks are fully streamable and can be organized in tag-based playlists. To lubricate the experience, they've invented an ajax navigation system that allows listeners to enjoy seamless audio playback across pageviews.",

After receiving funding from Y-Combinator in 2007, we produced Adpinion, one of the first advertising networks to utilize user feedback to drive personalized targeting.\n\nOur core technology — the recommendation engine called SparseReduce — has since proved infinitely adaptable in such diverse problem domains as Amazon product recommendation, eBay auction discovery, image and language comprehension, and Twitter stream exploration.\n\nThe latest application of SparseReduce is Appsaurus, an app discovery platform which was released on the eve of 2010 to overwhelming critical acclaim.\n\nWe're backed by some pretty incredible investors: Harrison Metal, Mitch Kapor, Chris Sacca, Y-Combinator and David Parker to name a few. We're also proud to have Alexis Ohanian as an advisor.",

These guys will also be taking a new spin on their idea, launching Disenchat.com, a place to post anonymously about your workplace. The system will verify your organization by email address (like Facebook) and let you start riffing.
